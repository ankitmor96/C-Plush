// 1) Intro :-

<img width="1018" height="532" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 103605" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a05294b8-263d-4f3f-9376-c11c35c203aa" />

C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language.
It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.
C++ is widely used for system software, games, applications, and competitive programming.

// 2) Encapsulation (Private) :-

<img width="998" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 102200" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a93d844-0275-4b41-912e-3d6f586378c5" />

Encapsulation means wrapping data and functions together in a class.
When data members are private, they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
This helps in data security and control.


// 3) Encapsulation (public) :-

<img width="976" height="593" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 102438" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfe259da-fd09-4979-8eeb-b82f2e68bead" />

Public members of a class can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
They are mainly used to provide access to private data using functions.

// 4) Inheritance (public):-

<img width="1021" height="571" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 102734" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83888df1-18d1-49c9-802a-9453fd2c7066" />

In public inheritance,

Public members → remain public

Protected members → remain protected
This allows maximum reusability and is the most commonly used inheritance type.

// 5) Inheritance (private) :-

<img width="981" height="580" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 103039" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a550b8e-26cc-401f-9499-4c2a42112ac5" />

In private inheritance,

Public and protected members of base class become private in derived class.
This limits access and is used when strict control is required.

// 6) Inheritance (Protected) :-

<img width="823" height="550" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 111645" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8091c846-d056-4bfa-89d2-2c1007af1ecb" />

In protected inheritance,

Public and protected members become protected in derived class.
They are accessible inside the class and child classes, but not from outside.

// 7) Leap year :-

<img width="1310" height="617" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 104051" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0dd8176-4f6d-4a2f-8445-0fb8d8588638" />

A leap year is:

Divisible by 4

Not divisible by 100 (unless divisible by 400)
This program checks and displays leap years within a given range.

// 8) Array :-

<img width="1126" height="576" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 104419" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d26e392-85e8-4cab-9437-0a57077e3eb1" />

An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.
Arrays are used to store multiple values efficiently.

// 9) Encapsulation Thiskeyword :-

The this keyword refers to the current object of the class.
It is used to differentiate between data members and function parameters with the same name.

// 10) Setter and getter :-

Setter → Sets or updates private data

Getter → Returns private data
This follows proper encapsulation principles and ensures controlled access.


// 11) Static :-

The static keyword is used to share data among all objects of a class.
Static members are created only once and memory is allocated only one time.

// 12) Parameterized Constructor :-

A parameterized constructor is a special member function of a class that accepts parameters and is used to initialize data members with user-defined values at the time of object creation.
